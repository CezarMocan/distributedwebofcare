Reflective of the society which we inhabit, discriminatory principles are embedded in this digital space through racist, sexist, and ableist ideologies and exclusionary algorithms. Jeff Chang writes in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://bealright.net/&quot;&gt;recent book&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;We Gon’ Be Alright: Notes on Race and Resegregation&lt;/em&gt;, “Segregation is still linked to racial disparities of every kind. Where you live plays a significant role in the quality of food and the quality of education available to you, your ability to get a job, buy a home, and build wealth, the kind of health care you receive and how long you live, and whether you will have anything to pass on to the next generation.” The ability to access online spaces and information can certainly be added to this list. As a disparity unfolds in this digital space, I see a responsibility to intervene in these systems of exclusion, and to build a more equitable web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is now a moment and opportunity to develop a different kind of internet, an internet which is more just, diverse and caring. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/07/introducing-the-d-web/&quot;&gt;distributed web&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes referred to as the decentralized web, presents an alternative to the centralization of the big five tech companies. Harnessing new protocols like IPFS, Dat and blockchain experiments, the distributed web is a peer-to-peer model, prioritizing collective agency and individual ownership of data and code. Much like its technological infrastructure of autonomous nodes, the development of the distributed web is a collaborative effort, based on the community’s genuine excitement about the do-it-yourself, grassroots approach to rebuilding the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dwc-tchoi8.hashbase.io/&quot;&gt;The Distributed Web of Care&lt;/a&gt; is an art project that engages this moment of technological change through performance, drawing, critical writing and community building to address the inequalities in the internet and the power dynamics within the traditional axis of technological production. Central to this project is the question: “What kind of network do we want for the future?” In redistributing the internet’s keys (literally as unique hashes for data and metaphorically as invitations to access), and infrastructure (the fiber optic cables connecting new and obsolete electronics), there is an opportunity to redistribute power and reconfigure who can code the principles and ideologies of our technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Distributed Web of Care seeks to shift the center of tech culture from corporations to a diverse community of technologists, artists, engineers, and scholars, holding identities across races, genders, privilege, and abilities. If the “new internet” is developed by people of color, women, queer folk, and differently abled people, we can imagine new protocols and networks, untethered by the constraints which have led to these voices to remain excluded. To bring equality to access and equity to ownership of technology, we need to create new narratives of the internet, tools for learning and empowerment, and systems of interdependence among communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issues of race, disability, habitat and gender all intersect in the places we live and interact in, whether physical or digital, on the condition of access. Social media and web 2.0 has encouraged a gentrification of the internet, where information is segregated and digital labor commodified. Aria Dean writes in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://reallifemag.com/poor-meme-rich-meme/&quot;&gt;Poor Meme, Rich Meme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; about the displacement of capital in the attention economy, in which young creators of memes, most often people of color, rarely get compensated while the tech giants profit from our engagement with these platforms. I see my practise as ‘networking,’ like weaving or knitting, where racial justice is the fundamental building block to examine and connect the intersectionalities of justice and equality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/racialjustice/01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remain struck by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/bloodorange/do-you-see-my-skin-through-the-flames&quot;&gt;song&lt;/a&gt;, “Do you see my skin through the flames” by artist Blood Orange, Dev Hynes. He writes, “Tasting pain coming from a place of truth, to be another in a messy world to feel like giving in another turn? You wouldn’t listen if I told you so how can I become anyone?” The transformation to become anyone, to surmount being another - or, an Other - necessitates a direct invitation to the spaces marginalized people have been told they can’t be anyone in. Beyond an invitation, artists can also visually intervene in the concept of the Other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example Roy Decarava, a photographer who was active during the ‘60s and onward. Teju Cole writes about his photography and its use of the commercially available films, optimized for light skin since the majority of consumers were white people preferring to look tan. This bias embedded in the technology of film led to photographs of people of color depicted with skin much darker. DeCarava uses the biased optics against itself, presenting a photograph of Mississippi Freedom Marchers in Washington D.C. in 1963, where the determination in her face is captured by the dark image. Rather than manipulate the photograph to make her skin brighter, DeCarava highlights both the subject’s presence in the photo and the exclusionary principles of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/racialjustice/DeCarava.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the consumer film of the ‘60s, software and protocol can condition reality to appear with bias. What’s urgent about racial justice now is to acknowledge we are not in a post-racial environment. The goal of the Distributed Web of Care is to expand the understanding of ‘code’ and ‘coder’ to a more racially diverse, inclusive and creative definition, building resources and a community invested in a more equitable internet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I consider the internet an environment, a space where limits are imposed upon access just as in physical, built environments.

&lt;p&gt;Can we code to care and code carefully? The Distributed Web of Care (DWC) is a research initiative on communication infrastructure, exploring the Distributed Web as a peer-to-peer, alternative web which prioritizes personhood, collective agency and individual ownership of data and code. Initiated by Taeyoon Choi, artist and cofounder of the School for Poetic Computation in NYC,  in collaboration with various artists, writers, technologists and community organizers, DWC imagines distributed networks as a form of interdependence and stewardship, in critical opposition to the network platforms and infrastructures that dominate the world today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At LACA, Taeyoon Choi will focus on archiving the DWC skillshares, performances and parties, and hold a few informal gatherings of LA based practitioners over home cooked meals. Follow their process on the project website and LACA’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/lacarchive/?hl=en&quot;&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A class at Code Societies Winter 2019 at the School for Poetic Computation in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distributed Web of Care is an initiative to code to care and code carefully. In this class there will engage in three different activities. First, we will investigate centralized, decentralized, distributed and peer to peer networks. We will analyze the popular technology platforms, focusing on its network infrastructure and terms of services. We will compare them with decentralized alternatives such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://datproject.org&quot;&gt;Dat&lt;/a&gt; Peer to Peer Protocol and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scuttlebutt.nz&quot;&gt;Scuttlebutt&lt;/a&gt;. Second, we will take on performative exercises to explore the feeling of being in a network. We will learn to move around in physical space with strings in order to care, not control, each other. Lastly, we will imagine the kinds of network we want for the future and we will discuss how we can build it with code and code of conduct. We will distribute our code and code of conduct as zines in physical print and data, published with Dat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exploration on the eradication of racial oppression in future times, through speculative design and futuristic ideating of a utopian city and society called, Afrotopolis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re fighting for a better future. But what does that future actually look like? What will it feel like when Black Americans are no longer living in intensely toxic situations that have been carefully designed for White American gain? What type of art would Black artists be able to make when we no longer have to simultaneously fulfill our artistic needs while also fighting to push our culture forward? What will happen when automation entirely wipes out the proletariat and a war on current societal standards have erupted? This is a speculative exploration on the future through a Blackness lens on the psycho-geography of afro-futurism and societal design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-1&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the Ace Hotel in New York City &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acehotel.com/newyork/events-and-spaces/calendar/detail/ace-air-taeyoon-ari-menlenciano/&quot;&gt;Artist-In-Residence&lt;/a&gt; (curated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://taeyoonchoi.com/&quot;&gt;Taeyoon Choi&lt;/a&gt;), I began my 24 hour residency by presenting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://distributedweb.care/posts/skillshares/&quot;&gt;skillshare&lt;/a&gt;, where there were about 15 participants, a mix of artists, designers, activists and engineers, who signed up to participate. The presentation started with a survey of my past works from building cameras, to creating a new media arts, culture and technology festival called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afrotectopia.com/&quot;&gt;Afrotectopia&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aricianoo/status/1002268551582048257&quot;&gt;data visualizations&lt;/a&gt; I’ve built that analyze the relationships between music video cinematography with the rhetoric and sentiments within lyrics. After the survey of past works, I dived into more recent thoughts on the structure of America and the ways these structures have been identified and highlighted within different pieces of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/air/ari/01_Ari.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;lets-talk-about-race-oprah-magazine--photographer-chris-buck&quot;&gt;“Let’s Talk About Race” Oprah Magazine | Photographer: Chris Buck&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This survey included monumental work photographed by Chris Buck for the Oprah Magazine (May 2017) that highlights stereotypes and offers an opportunity to reimagine, by reversing them — as well as the hyper-surveillance of Black communities by police, that Jay Z communicates in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5fxxMRzi1Q&quot;&gt;Marcy Me&lt;/a&gt; music video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;marcy-mejay-z-music-video-screenshots&quot;&gt;Marcy Me — Jay Z (music video screenshots)&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My presentation then shifted to the job of activists and the feelings of being “jaded”. Which, inevitably becomes a sort of Activism Exhaust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/air/ari/03_Ari.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Activism Exhaust&lt;/em&gt; is the feeling of being “low on fuel” after having exercised various forms of activism for extensive periods of time. It is a frustration that occurs when success and progress within the fights for civil human rights is difficult to identify through standard success metrics. Thankfully, through several conversations with friends and colleagues— I was able to experience necessary paradigm shifts to reinvigorate my sense of possibilities within my own activism work. One included a conversation with Rashida Richardson, a lawyer that spoke on the &lt;em&gt;Black Resistance White Algorithms&lt;/em&gt; panel at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.afrotectopia.com/&quot;&gt;Afrotectopia&lt;/a&gt;. In brainstorming possible solutions for the advancement of Black society, she noted how our fight as activists was missing a key element: a constructive and well-researched idea of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/air/ari/04_Ari.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;illustration-by-ari-melenciano&quot;&gt;Illustration by Ari Melenciano&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving that conversation inspired me to begin my future activist work by defining an ideal place in time of racial equity and then move backward, creating a series of steps on how to get to this utopia. My thinking shifted from “how do we create a &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; equitable future for the Black society?” to, “what does an ideal society for Black people &lt;strong&gt;look&lt;/strong&gt; like, and what steps would need to be taken to get there?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this new paradigm, I also spent more time researching digital carceral infrastructure (Jackie Wang’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/carceral-capitalism&quot;&gt;Carceral Capitalism&lt;/a&gt; has become a new favorite), technological automation’s effect on the proletariat, geo-political activism, and different forms of speculative design. Through this lens, I embarked on a more intense analysis of current societal structures, beginning with capitalism and decentralized vs. centralized forms of access — to eventually building my own society and vision for the future, called Afrotopolis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/air/ari/05_Ari.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/air/ari/06_Ari.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new paradigm allowed me to dive deeper into an older idea of mine titled, The Afronet — which would serve as a key component in the development of Afrotopolis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black culture is Black society’s most lucrative export. It is also currently the world’s most profitable culture. Yet, the Black producers of this culture are barely receiving any of the monetary gains, while those that do have the capital to invest in the exploitation of Black culture for capital gain, which are predominately White men, are the only ones truly able to profit off of the culture. It is a cycle of cultural exploitation through racial expropriation via culture vultures funded by venture capitalists who’s ability to exist is off of the backs of poor, Black citizens. So, what sort of tool could be developed to no longer give access to Black culture to the people that do not quintessentially understand it or its history? What sort of system could be developed so that Black culture producers are the only ones profiting off of their creations (or at least profiting the most)? How would America have been able to operate differently if the ability to access a youtube video of Jay Z first required the ability to pass a series of tests analyzing one’s comprehension of Blackness and racial politics? Ideally, the development of The Afronet, would inspire new forms of radical digital activism for other cultures — similar to how the construction and practices of the Black Panther Party inspired the Chicano Brown Berets and Puerto Rican Young Lords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this exploration and development of Afrotopolis, I established a series of common values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;values-of-afrotopolis-illustration-by-ari-melenciano&quot;&gt;Values of Afrotopolis, Illustration by Ari Melenciano&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My study progressed to focus on what has currently and previously occurred in various societies around the world — that I feel should be dismantled for the sake of mankind. I began exploring how social media introduces and exercises a form of social capital, and how social media has introduced hyper levels of individualism that may be doing more harm than good. As opposed to collective contribution to a communal society, we are finding odd situations occur — like non-profits of similar objectives competing for the same pool of money (maybe one entity feels that they are more equipped to handle the job than the other — which is understandable, but maybe one group aims for a larger amount of power — which requires a sort of hypocritical oppression of the other) or bureaucracy getting in the way of societal advancement that would better the lives of millions. This ties to a sort of greed (which I believe is current society’s greatest flaw) that is produced by capitalism. Social media has bred a new form of individualism that makes faces and identity a form of currency. It is a type of individualism that is intensely competitive and one that establishes new forms of digital oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/air/ari/08_Ari.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form of individualism’s most common objective is fame. Fame, i’ve found, is strongly tied to capitalism. What if, in this new society of Afrotopolis, individualism was dismantled and replaced with communal strategy for holistic cultural advancement of all? Would that require the elimination of capitalism? I’m currently not finding a way that fame (in it’s current framework) could succeed without capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ideas were presented in the skillshare part of the Distributed Web of Care residency. They were followed by an open discussion on afrofuturism, socialism, Blackness, hegemony, decentralized web structures and more — held both inside the Ace Hotel’s Boardroom and in Madison Square Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-ii&quot;&gt;Part II&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of the Distributed Web of Care residency, was a speculative design practice and social experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In returning to this idea of &lt;em&gt;Activism Exhaust&lt;/em&gt;, I wanted to give a few of my friends and I a chance to explore a future where we no longer have to be activists of racial oppresion. This exploration tied back to my questions at the beginning of this essay:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What will it feel like when Black Americans are no longer living in intensely toxic situations that have been carefully designed for White American gain? What type of art would Black artists be able to make when we no longer have to simultaneously fulfill our artistic needs while also fighting to push our culture forward? What will happen when automation entirely wipes out the proletariat and a war on current societal standards have erupted?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To speculatively answer these questions, I designed a space for my friends and I to enter and explore with deep imagination, for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We entered into the year, 2371.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the timeline of events:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/air/ari/20_Ari.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2100, the massive amounts of investments and research that were being poured into the advancements of technological automation (machine learning and artificial intelligence) had completely wiped out the proletariat — producing an extreme level of poverty, exponentially greater than ever experienced before. As introduced by Walter Mosley in his short read, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/folding-red-black-walter-mosley/&quot;&gt;Folding the Read into the Black&lt;/a&gt;, I began to further explore the possibility of AI technology developers being taxed for their productions by metrics of the human labor it has eradicated. By 2150, this taxation on AI would be heavily enforced in attempt to supplement the displacement of the previously existing working class. By 2150, there is a war on capitalism and a true Power to the People Revolution, where the oppressed people of the entire world would unify in the redistribution of access to sustainable living. This would also be the era when the Afronet has fully infiltrated the centralized web network — creating immense amounts of capital for the Black society, right before capitalism is completely destroyed. By 2250, capitalism no longer exists, the tax on automation has eliminated classism by providing all with a bountiful amount of resources to sustain a desired life. Afrotopolis is considered a true Republic of The People, and has completely redefined societal standards — reflecting the Afrotopolis values aforementioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this speculative design experience, the idea was that we had traveled to the year 2371, which was generations further into the future from the war on capitalism and the true Power to the People revolution — leaving the current society in opportunity to relish in this new world of equality in regards to civil rights, distribution of power, and access. Humans alive in the year of 2371 were 353 years removed from the tribulations of today, and deeply immersed in a world that no longer required them to be activists of racial advancement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this context, each participant of the night was then given an entirely new identity and told that they have been invited by the archivists of El Museo de Afrotopolis, to contribute their art into this museum. These moments throughout the experience were possibly the most disorienting as each person in the room currently (today in 2018) creates art that somehow stems from their racial identity, and ways that it oppresses their agency. How would it feel to no longer have that responsibility, but to instead be able to create purely for art’s sake? Would the art we create be purely for art’s sake or would we have other subjects to focus on? We started off with a 45 minute long conversation exploring the possibilities of our new realities, over a group dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/air/ari/21_Ari.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/air/ari/23_Ari.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then spent the next 30 minutes creating art as we further imagined where we’d artistically communicate from, with this new reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tao, re-identified as Pumoash, was a dancer, dance coach and urban designer who also enjoyed traveling, going to broadways and baking sweets. Pumoash studied historical games, including Dance Dance Revolution to create, “Dance Dance Revolution Architecture as dancing 2150 Power to the People Revolution as dance dance as revolution urban design + dance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terrell, re-identified as Yayot, was a digital media artist and painter who professionally practiced computer science and bartending and also enjoyed meditating, drawing and problem solving, in their free time. Yayot created “an interactive tool to compile stories of local customers to capture the stories behind bar visits. Customers tell, bar captures, the tech appropriates data into viable info for population.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandra, re-identified as Oeii, was a writer and journalist for the Afrotropolis Times who was also passionate about the bioengineering of fruits and international recipes. In describing her work, she said, “Art is a written connection of questions and quotes around identity, memory, ancestry, and food. Also, recipes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romil, re-identified as Nellano, was a street artist, public sculpture artist and carpenter who enjoyed sculpting with soap bars and watching indie films. For his piece, “Population Projection”, Nellano created an “LED wall with wooden dials. Dials change societal variables to project impacts on population. LED wall also shows historical population changes over time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ari (me), re-identified as Mirable, was a cake designer, physicist and molecular scientist who enjoyed cycling, reading vintage sci-fi novels and painting portraits of animals. Through a “series of image manipulations”, Mirable used “part one [to create] illustrations of cakes .. morphed into other objects of abstract form” and “part two [consisted of] photos of Black women of the 21st century … gone through a series of digital distortions — changing their hair and appearance as they attempted to fit into White notions of beauty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night brought incredible insight and new alterations to current paradigms of thought. We meditated heavily on thoughts of what the necessary levels of maturity might be needed to experience a night like this (Terrell), how our place in the world changes when we thinking of future societies being descendants of our actions of today (Tsige), what freedom actually means, and what Blackness means absent of oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the audio from the night was recorded, to create a genuine sense of liberty and freedom within our creativity, as well as security and safety within our expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning was spent documenting the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been spending time with Barbara Smith’s essay, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://webs.wofford.edu/hitchmoughsa/Toward.html&quot;&gt;Towards a Black Feminist Criticism&lt;/a&gt;.” A lot of time, actually. It has become a central point of reference for me recently as I’ve worked to get to the root of my impulses as an art critic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long before I tried to write this I felt I was attempting to do something unprecedented, something dangerous…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1978, Smith is working towards an impossibility, as she describes, that aims to render visible, through criticism, the literature of Black women writers, especially Black lesbian writers. How does one move against silence(s)? How has the literature of Black women not been served by the larger apparatus of literary criticism (For Smith: white male critics, Black male critics, white woman critics who think of themselves as feminists)? For her part then, Smith puts forth a methodology—the how— that takes seriously the entanglement of race, class, and the politics of sex in any effort to understand the subtleties of Black women’s writing. I like to imagine the following question as subtext: through what lens do you attend to the work of Black women?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1978, I also imagine Smith arguing that even before we get to the how, we must first acknowledge another inquiry: do you attend to the work of Black women? Here I am, almost 40 years after the publishing of this essay feeling like I gotta carry Smith with me at all times as I set priorities for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am often asked: who are you writing for? This question is typically followed by: why do you write? To employ a praxis of Black feminist criticism means that I write to place care around the practices of Black women artists. Their work. Their archives. Their fullness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criticism, then, is a way of showing up. It is a way of placing intellectual frameworks around the gestures and processes of artists. It is a way of preventing gaps and exclusions. What is most urgent for me now is engaging in a critical practice that moves against silences and undertakes assessments of visual, performance, and literary culture in a manner that centers and prioritizes the complexities of black womanhood(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black feminist criticism would by definition be highly innovative, embodying the daring spirit of the works themselves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I was in a room full of Black women artists, friends of mine, discussing our big dreams and expressing our big frustrations. “Who is going to do the real thinking about us,” one friend began, “most of this writing is fluff shit.” I nodded my head in agreement. That she made a distinction between the real and the fluff didn’t surprise me. The fluff: surface level analysis, press release regurgitation. The real: deep level, nuanced meditations. “I’m not sure the market is interested in that type of art criticism,” I say. “We’re all writing the same things about the same artist because it’s profitable. It’s a numbers game.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need a new criticism then,” this friend says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, it is true that the job of the critic is to respond in real time. That if an exhibition or gallery show is on view for, let’s say, four months, a strong and early review can be leveraged by an artist for future opportunities. This is especially true for emerging artists (a precarious term but one I will use for the sake of this essay). I will contend here that a strong piece of criticism is not merely one that lauds an artist. It is also a text that contextualizes, proposes new questions, and insightfully articulates what is working and what is not working. On the other hand, as newspapers and magazines shutter their arts coverage and more and more of us cobble together livelihoods from freelance writing or write in addition to full-time jobs ( I am one of these people), it is also true that what is lacking is both time and presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That when my friend calls for a “new criticism” she is calling for a new way by which critics form a relationship to her work. This is to say that, perhaps, a Black Feminist criticism offers a space for this new relationship, one that dares me to slow down and make space for intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I only hope that this essay is one way of breaking our silence and our isolation, of helping us to know each other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Black woman critic maturing alongside Black women artists. I conduct studio visits with them. I go to their openings and talks and panels. We have our group chats and email threads. They are my peers and colleagues and sounding boards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our exchanges, formal and informal, constitute a necessary, generative meeting point in which we might challenge, provoke, and support one another. I’m not entirely convinced my eye is compromised because of this proximity though such is the argument with which I wrestle. We are women coming from the peripheries and we are seeing one another and we are holding on to one another and we are holding one another accountable. I guess what I’m trying to say is that maybe (art) criticism should also make space for the rigor that can arise when we orient ourselves horizontally. What does criticism look like when we reject the myth that it can only manifest itself in one way? I want to propose that intimacy in criticism serves both a political and aesthetic purpose as it moves us closer to planes of formal experimentation (as in, how does your criticism show up on the page) while allowing for a sustained close reading of a body of work as it unfolds over time in other words, an investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just as I did not know where to start, I am not sure how to end. I feel that I have tried to say too much and at the same time have left too much unsaid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll probably return to Smith a few more times before the year ends. Criticism is not static. There is much left to learn. And so, this feels less like an ending and more a righteous beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What does it mean to be “stuck with words” or “reading between the lines” or “not reading into anything” as a hearing impaired person? Read on for a poetic exploration…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(from: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;still stuck with language&lt;/strong&gt;, still stuck with words, still stuck with what you know…” (poet Jack Spicer, from one of his lectures)&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On those words, I’m going to start with a poem:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-with&quot;&gt;WHAT WITH,&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is how it’s said, how it’s meant, how it’s told, how it’s sent, what with all the what you meant with what got you last time with all the clutter in the air, what with all the things we said we’d never become, we’d never do, we’d never shame, we’d never be game for, what with all those years you said you’d never skip, you’d never cross off with x’s, the what you said you meant with the what with her, and what with him, and what with them, and what with the neighbors upstairs who blast the deep bass boom box til three in the morning, what with your booming dreams that resemble drag car races what does the upstairs boom box matter anyway, what with all the stuff you said what it was that drove home what it was you meant with her, what it was she went without with, you know without with, without with, without with what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-with-words&quot;&gt;What’s with words?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be all CliffsNotes-y, but what I’m writing here has to do with language. I know that’s broad. But how I use it (I suppose as a hearing impaired person) for poetry (how I might be suggesting to use it, how I see it used?), its messages between the lines, its repetition, its saying the unsayable; how does it even work with our purposes if we are “still stuck with words”? If they are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;just words&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, then where does the emotion come in? If they are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; words are we always reading in between the lines? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s a good question…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That phrase (“&lt;em&gt;that’s a good question&lt;/em&gt;”) brings me to: The use of the colloquial as bridging together experimental language and the effect that has on our reading it… What does that mean? This is related to: class. It’s this use of the colloquial that brings me to class, working classness, the speech of that class, that is filtered through my writing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And on “reading between the lines” and contradictorily, “don’t read into anything” – these colloquialish phrases – which I admit I feel affinity with in this quest to get poetry written:&lt;/strong&gt; If we are to read in between everything we write and say, and also &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; read into anything, are we always sorting through hidden meanings, and if so, what does &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This leads me to think of repetition-&lt;/strong&gt;
Why do it, when outside of the artistic realm, we’ve been told not to, so much of the time (“that’s what you said yesterday” and so forth). Why should artists and poets keep doing it?  This brings up what Gertrude Stein called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;insistence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Repeating subtle variations to be “heard” about the din of a crowd. Digging thru this insistence through philosophical inflection, and have an epiphany sneak up on you at the end of the poem when you weren’t expecting it. Not that I can perfectly explain how that happens. On being mystified on what mysteries language holds contradictorily in both its &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;breaking apart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;its words coming together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
All of this mixes with what I don’t hear, mishear, and what I want to hear, merging in a full-on experiment. Working with this mix (insistence, repetition, hearing loss…) drives my poetix to getting to the bottom of other concerns of mine in poetry: time-based-ness, nostalgia, dejavu, memory. And with memory(ies), I don’t think we can ever get to the bottom of them. 
All of these investigations lead to a kind of internal rhythm, a kind of music, (but with no sound) in my poetry, a kind of music both figuratively and literally. Perhaps one would expect a person with a hearing loss to not quote so many pop songs, but they’re there, place holders for what couldn’t be said otherwise. So it’s a meta meta &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;what’s been said&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, to say what I wanna say. In this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;word-music&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; created with the line, the motion of one phrase never really slows, and the prose poem format makes it feel like nothing can afford to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then there’s the Schoolhouse Rock effect-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOT THIS BUT THAT&lt;/em&gt; from the song “Conjunction Junction what’s your function” (Schoolhouse Rock was a 70s educational children’s TV show). That phrase and the images of its animated train cars smashing together with the words &lt;em&gt;NotThisButThat&lt;/em&gt; seem to be the CliffsestNotest way I can say what is in my mind when I’m trying to write. How words, ideas, and phrases come together, and my going along or against it. Just like those train cars slamming together.
How to pry open that meaning – when we say “not just this or just that” – what is the space AROUND “just this” or “just that”? It’s a loaded space. Where can you go with it? There’s gazillions of these spaces, this reading between, a space filled with something. Why is this even something to explore, this “space” around the throwaway phrases that only exist with a reading between?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“That’s a good question…”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is poetry a sophisticated attempt to read between the lines, put it down on paper, so you’re not reading between the lines anymore on one level, but when you start reading between the lines of what is already the poet’s view of reading between the lines, what are we doing then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A very good question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The translation that’s involved in reading between the lines, that quiet invisible space.
Now if we were always reading between the lines, which implies finding that hidden truth –  the “real deal” – then – is this what is needed to really “get at”  the heart of something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good question.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to intercept here with a poem of mine that feels appropriate in this essay’s juncture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This poem is called “I’m telling you don’t forget”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember who you were&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember what it was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember what it is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember how it was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember what it went&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember how it said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember how it sounded&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember how it went&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember what they did&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember how it goes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember what it meant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember that’s what she said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember what it aint&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember who said what&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember what said what&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember who knew who&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember who died then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember who all knew who&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember what was what&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember who didn’t die&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember who said what they said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember who didn’t remember you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember who didn’t want to know&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember who tried to change you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember don’t be a cliché here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember don’t let this poem be 8th grade desperation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember you’re trying to do something with 8th grade desperation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember maybe you can deconstruct 8th grade desperation in a way the language poets would like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or A Tonalists&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or Quietudes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember, once again, all together now, the more things change the more they stay the same&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember most poets don’t want to hear that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember most news publications have a rule for what not to say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Including&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more things change the more they stay the same&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember most people will forget you said earlier in this poem it was a sophisticated attempt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To turn around a cliché&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can it be encapsulated in Hey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe, ok?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember maybe these lines need to be more of a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember somebody might be reading between the lines&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember there’s a poem in between the lines&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remember in between the lines is where everything happens&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why should I even write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An extremely good question.&lt;/strong&gt;   Is it possible to rest our poetics on a question. To think we can. I think we can –let the poetry move long after it has ended. To quote what I just read, “Why should I even write anything.” I just did. So there. Translate as needed. 
It feels like maybe I haven’t really said anything there/here with the some things I said…In these in between the lines, insistences, repetitions…getting at…an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;un-destination…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; To get at an un-defined space of between the lines. 
Is this &lt;em&gt;reading between&lt;/em&gt; another way to say – that we are trying to use poetry to say the unsayable, to speak the unspeakable, the unexplainable? If that’s what poetry may be …&lt;em&gt;what are we actually saying here?: “Yeah I know it’s unsayable in “regular” language?” So what’s regular?&lt;/em&gt;
Even though I tried to make “reading between the lines” sound all fancy, that is a layperson’s phrase after all which brings me back to filtering class through everything it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m curious when it’s said that a poet is “just” playing around with words. Does this mean that wordplay for poets is “just that” there is no deeper relationship to the cumulative effect of the repetition? 
I think I’m surprised by such a question. I think the cumulative effect does do something. That shouting across a loud room to be heard. Or maybe a quiet room with someone who heard you but &lt;em&gt;didn’t hear&lt;/em&gt; you and said HUH? as in &lt;em&gt;WAIT WHAT&lt;/em&gt; are you saying? Then there’s the strait, or bent up reason for repetition for me, of course, my &lt;em&gt;hearing loss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be said my poetics practice and filmmaking practice are related. Is there a relationship between the lining up of images together &lt;strong&gt;to&lt;/strong&gt; the lining of sentences or words together (even if are stuck with them?) Probably. And probably because of my hearing loss I “see” images and thoughts moving by like frames, more than I “hear” actual sounds or words. (Well, that is literally; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;internally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is probably another story.) Yet, I do “hear” gaps and repetition simultaneously when I “see” them. Translating that to my filmmaking practice can mean a similarity when I shoot a recurring image or fade-outs over and over. These film effects could have something in common with how I “&lt;em&gt;hear&lt;/em&gt;” tonal inflection even tho I may not &lt;em&gt;hear&lt;/em&gt; all the words. So if I don’t &lt;em&gt;hear&lt;/em&gt; all the words, in the way that film collects repeated images to be spliced together to make meaning, perhaps the use of repetition invites comparisons to such taping together of film frames (or words/sentences for poetry’s purposes).  Though most of my films actually are “edited in camera”, which means I carefully shoot scene after scene intuitively or like jazz improvisation, and I don’t actually cut the film up afterwards. That could be said is same as what I’m doing in prose poems – with that internal rhythm that’s created – that hopefully should counter prose poem doubters who say the prose poem doesn’t do ENUF with the LINE…The same could be said for edited-in-camera doubters who say those of us who “edit in camera” don’t do ENUF with “editing”. It’s simply a different way of creating  - A WAY OF SEEING, a phrase I’m borrowing from many a poet and filmmaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I near the end of this essay, what does it truly mean to read between the lines? What exactly is the reading? What exactly are the lines? As a hearing impaired, working class queer, what does it mean for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; to “read between the lines” and for others to “read me” between the(se) lines?  To find “the official story”, how far we must “dig” and “re-read” to discover truths – even truths that could be right in our face? Perhaps poetry and film can be ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the next time someone tells you to “read between the lines” and to not “read into anything” ask yourself, what does that really mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dance floor is a network. Bodies are nodes and the connections between them are edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; dance floor is distributed. There is no central authority of movement, but we share the principles of the music. Individual bodies contribute to a collective energy and we move to maintain it throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-distributed-dance-floor-has-taught-me-the-following&quot;&gt;The Distributed Dance Floor has taught me the following:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/party/DDFDrawings.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resiliency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peer to peer connections increase the momentum of the network by increasing the number of edges our movement can be shared through. When we dance, we connect and when we connect, we seed. Seeding increases resiliency. The dance floor dies when nodes feel disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authentication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we dance, we use eye contact to check and verify the authenticity of our peers. While mostly fleeting, it is a way of sharing support and signing our connection into the network. For that moment, nodes become edges and a trust algorithm is performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swarming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dance floor is continuously collecting resources in an effort to redistribute them. The distributed web doesn’t centralize around any one dancer for more than a moment; the attention is shared. After we connect around a node, the swarm rejoins the network with connections stronger than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I see it, there is one fundamental challenge: the dance floor is ephemeral. It is not built to scale. What we grow tonight will not be here tomorrow. And I have wondered - is the same true for a distributed network? Is there a limit to how much we can prioritize care over control?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if the individual dance floor doesn’t last, the nodes and edges that maintain them do. The distributed web is survived by its dancers. The dance floor is as sustainable as the peer to peer connections it supports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through an intimate interactive event, participants and artists will develop a dialog related to their practices by performing acts of collective caring, discussion and documentation.
As a participant in the skillshare, all we require is an open mind and desire to share together. We will be experimenting with different modes of documentation throughout the events. &lt;strong&gt;We will also send out a small set of readings and ask you to generate a few questions based on those readings so we can come together with an informed baseline.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be four skillshares held between July 1st and July 22nd, culminating in a vibrant party in July 29th where the fellows and stewards from the Distributed Web of Care project will present their work on both tools and theory on a web of care, not control. Space is limited for the skillshare event. Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://airtable.com/shrnr16Oq6oalF1S1&quot;&gt;RSVP here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peer to peer protocols require trust and the negotiation of shared resources - so does the dance floor. Webs of moving bodies and sound are an ideal environment to understand how we can, and already do, prioritize care over control within a system. With a good enough groove, peers work together without ever skipping a beat. ‘100 Scores’ by Lai Yi Ohlsen is a repository of improvisational movement scores based upon computer science algorithms. For DWC she will present scores related to the potential of the distributed, peer to peer web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meme culture and fast-paced social networking have encouraged the use of copyrighted resources without proper attribution. This talk will highlight the benefits of open-access, show a selection of available public domain and Creative Commons archives, and address best practices and fair use uses of institutional repositories and other people’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants will engage in a conversation about gathering and using data from the web for social good. The steward will briefly show recent projects and we will use these examples to create a dialog about the legal and ethical issues involved in such projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Distributed Web of Care Party will be held at the Liberty Hall at Ace Hotel New York on July 29th from 5-9pm. The party will be a collection of talks, presentations, interactions and music to illustrate the collective power of caring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team of Fellows, Stewards and Artists in residence will all contribute toward sharing their knowledge and expertise in a series of talks concerning the distributed web. These talks will be both technical and abstract, but grounded in the project’s mission:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Care, in contrast to cure, is a form of stewardship between people who support each other in communication, action, and social engagement. It is actualized by extending one’s mindfulness of another person’s dignity and feelings, while respecting their independence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the talks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laiyiohlsen.com/&quot;&gt;Lai Yi Ohlsen&lt;/a&gt; will lead a distributed dance. &lt;a href=&quot;http://laurelschwulst.com/&quot;&gt;Laurel Schwulst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdxs.ist/&quot;&gt;Becca Abbe&lt;/a&gt; will be doing live drawing with code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event will progress into dancing and socializing with music curated by the multi-instrumental artist and DJ &lt;a href=&quot;http://stud1nt.nyc/&quot;&gt;stud1nt&lt;/a&gt; of Discwoman.&lt;/p&gt;
