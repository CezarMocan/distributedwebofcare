<h2 id="open-sourceculturetech-citizenship">Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship</h2>

<p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.</p>

<p>Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. We seek to create an open and sharing environment deeply based in open source practice.</p>

<p>All open source (licensed or otherwise) and copyrighted work that is integrated into work inside and outside of the Distributed Web of Care event must be appropriately adhered to under the referenced work’s license guidelines.</p>

<p>If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.</p>

<h2 id="expected-behavior">Expected Behavior</h2>
