The Distributed Web of Care presents a skillshare series called **Peers in Practice.** This series invites the artists in residence at the Ace Hotel to investigate the distribution of power, autonomy and control.

Through an intimate interactive event, participants and artists will develop a dialog related to their practices by performing acts of collective caring, discussion and documentation.
As a participant in the skillshare, all we require is an open mind and desire to share together. We will be experimenting with different modes of documentation throughout the events. **We will also send out a small set of readings and ask you to generate a few questions based on those readings so we can come together with an informed baseline.**

There will be four skillshares held between July 1st and July 22nd, culminating in a vibrant party in July 29th where the fellows and stewards from the Distributed Web of Care project will present their work on both tools and theory on a web of care, not control. Space is limited for the skillshare event. Please [RSVP here](https://airtable.com/shrnr16Oq6oalF1S1).

The skillshare will also include the following short workshops presented by stewards of the DWC project:

[**Lai Yi Ohlsen**](http://www.laiyiohlsen.com/)

[**Juliana Castro**](http://julianacastro.co/)

Meme culture and fast-paced social networking have encouraged the use of copyrighted resources without proper attribution. This talk will highlight the benefits of open-access, show a selection of available public domain and Creative Commons archives, and address best practices and fair use uses of institutional repositories and other people's work. 

[**Zach Coble**](http://zachcoble.com/)

Participants will engage in a conversation about gathering and using data from the web for social good. The steward will briefly show recent projects and we will use these examples to create a dialog about the legal and ethical issues involved in such projects.
