The Distributed Web of Care presents a skillshare series called **Peers in Practice.** This series invites the artists in residence at the Ace Hotel to investigate the distribution of power, autonomy and control.

Through an intimate interactive event, participants and artists will develop a dialog related to their practices by performing acts of collective caring, discussion and documentation.
As a participant in the skillshare, all we require is an open mind and desire to share together. We will be experimenting with different modes of documentation throughout the events. **We will also send out a small set of readings and ask you to generate a few questions based on those readings so we can come together with an informed baseline.**

There will be four skillshares held between July 1st and July 22nd, culminating in a vibrant party in July 29th where the fellows and stewards from the Distributed Web of Care project will present their work on both tools and theory on a web of care, not control. Space is limited for the skillshare event. Please [RSVP here](https://airtable.com/shrnr16Oq6oalF1S1).
