# about

This is Laurel Schwulst's Beaker Browser website.

It's only hosted on the p2p web. Please seed if you like!

Laurel is using this website to write more. How can the process of writing be more similar to some of her other favorite things -- like walking? like nature? like the wind? like that apocalyptic dawn feeling? Oh, and she only blogs to this website while she's [in motion](../log/18-04-24-in-motion.md).

She's been interested in websites for a long time. She enjoys their "alive-ness". She likes that they're an inherently self-perfecting medium. What is so special about a website? And what is so special about the p2p web â€” does it exemplify the best aspects of a website? And how can writing and p2p come together in blissful harmony?

This notebook is called [ellipsis](../pages/quotes.md) because it's never meant to be complete...

<!-- Why am I writing in the third person? -->
