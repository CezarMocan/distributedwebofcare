# #beakercore

*"beaker is as beaker does..."* — Casey Gollan

The way the page flashes for a second, turning markdown into HTML, is so #beakercore. That flash tells you that computers thinking takes time, too.

The "Raw" button in the upper right hand corner is also very #beakercore. You can tell where things come from and how they're made this way. Click "Raw" to view the page as markdown.

Low point of entry is so #beakercore.

Text is lightweight food for Beaker and is therefore #beakercore.

It’s #beakercore that you have to synchronously debug back and forth together. When you want to share something with someone, you can’t just wetransfer a file and run out the door ... you have to literally PUSH!
