<!-- "All jokes aside there are actually many theories and deep lore that goes back to the beginning of the internet on what p2p web actually is. Scholars, scientists, and secret esoteric guilds have all been studying and experimenting with it in greater success than others. However in the end it doesn't really matter and ultimately it comes down to you. You are the chosen one and you can make p2p web GREAT! Only you and your unique talents and abilities hold the key to unlocking its true potential. You happen to find yourself at the start of the path before many have even started looking. Congratulations! I won't lie, this journey will not be easy and many have tried and not made it, see #notonline. It is the brutal reality of life and sometimes one must be extinguished to be reborn again. It is possible to simply leave and rejoin at your leisure. If you can and can believe in yourself, to be more, I believe in you, and p2p web believes in you. Go forth and build the internet of your dreams!"

"The idea hovered and shimmered delicately, like a soap bubble, and she dared not even look at it directly in case it burst. But she was familiar with the way of ideas, and she let it shimmer, looking away, thinking about something else." — The Golden Compass

How does a metropolis create conditions in which people find it hard to find themselves?

In a primitive society, he had merely to integrate the traditional beliefs (in a sense, there was a self already there for the asking), in modern society each person has literally to fabricate a self, for himself, out of the chaos of values that surround him.

It seems then, that the metropolis creates weak character in two almost opposite ways; first, because people are exposed to a chaos of values; second, because they cling to the superficial uniformity common to all these values. A nondescript mixture of values will tend to produce nondescript people.
