# déjà vu

I'm on the Metra commuter train going from Chicago to my hometown. The windows are oval and green.

Surprisingly, there is wifi on this train. Of course, I'm not letting it stop me from blogging. I'm also happy and lucky the train wifi is quite slow.

The peer to peer talk recordings went live yesterday. I produced / added slides to some of them, including my own.

I really enjoy the activity of adding slides to someone's talk. First, it's nice because I get to rewatch the talk in an active way. And second, hopefully the way I place the slides gives new resonance to the talk... both selfishly for me, the maker, but also for the author of the talk and anyone watching the recording. I also like that it plainly makes the recording artifact decidedly different than the event.

When I've done this before (well, I guess it's only been a couple times -- I produced [some lecture videos](http://veryinteractive.net/videos) for my class), I've tried to make the recording even more different than the actual event by asking the person who gave the talk for their whole folder of inspiration images or texts, especially the ones that didn't make it into slide format. Then I put those on top of the video in a way that hopefully draws new, surprising connections.

I've been thinking about déjà vu recently. I had my inaugural DJ debut last Saturday, and I purposely played multiple versions of the same song. Maybe they're covers, or maybe they are in different languages or played by different instruments. These "mirror" songs included: Debussy's "Claire de Lune", The Cranberries' "Dreams", Yukihiro Takahashi's "Drip Dry Eyes", and Mark Owen's "Magic Love".
