# sea of punctuation

Moments of punctuation are vital in a never-ending flow of information. Sometimes these moments are arbitrary, and other times they're intentional.

This blog is certainly a form of deliberate punctuation. But I don't always choose when to blog. Sometimes I find myself in transit, text editor open miraculously. I liked the motion constraint because it added the semi-frequent ritual based on my existing lifestyle.

I seek a mix between deliberate and unconscious punctuation or publication. I think you need a healthy balance of both to come to some sort of an understanding. In the first, you're making the decision. In the other, you only realize it after the fact. Publication as side effect.<sup>1</sup>

There was an Are.na x SY Partners meetup a couple weeks ago. During the conversation, I mentioned the folder on iMessage where all the photos you've sent and received are kept on your computer. It's a very mysterious but powerful set of images. Together, each is like a little publication you didn't even know you were building with someone else.

(By the way, here are some [instructions](http://osxdaily.com/2014/12/03/access-attachments-messages-mac-os-x/) on how find that folder. And for quick future reference: Command + Shift + G in Finder, then type ~/Library/Messages/Attachments. Then do a smart search in finder to only show images contained within this "Attachments" folder.)

But beware -- you might be lost in those search results for hours... it's almost too rich. I wish there were an easier way to traverse it.

(I'm typing to you while riding from New Haven to New York, listening to DJ Python's *Dulce Compa√±ia*. It's raining, and I'm going backwards.)
