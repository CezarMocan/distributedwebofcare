# editing notes

6.14.18
- I think I've blogged twice now since my last update. [Once](../log/18-06-14-deja-vu.md) on the Chicago commuter line, and the [other time](../log/18-06-06-print-will-live-as-long-as-we-are-waiting.md) on the Amtrak from New York to Cambridge.

5.22.18
- I added a [page](../pages/beakercore.md) called "beakercore".
- New record. I wrote two blogs in one day! It was raining, perfect for writing.
-- My first [blog](../log/18-05-22a-technology-is-the-answer.md) I composed while riding the train from New York to New Haven.
-- And my second [blog](../log/18-05-22b-sea-of-punctuation.md) happened the other way.

5.21.18
- I changed some of the colors on this site, feeling better.
- I wrote a [blog](../log/18-05-21-time-is-actually-really-important.md) while riding the train to Rockaway Beach. I only made it to Broad Channel, though, because I was going to be late to dinner if I went any further.
- I edited some pages and created this page at Elliott's apartment, <i>Peach House</i>, while drinking ros√©, waiting for dinner.
