# questions

- How do I find other people using Beaker outside of links? Or are links the only way, like the old web?

- I couldn't get my friends to see this website without mirroring it on hashbase. Why? Is my computer not strong enough?? How can I debug this problem?

- Relatedly, why encourage hashbase when it's centralizing? Feels very un-p2p to me...

- When I showed Beaker to some artist friends of mine, they got excited, and their first impulse was to use it as an easy way to share files. But sites with big files on Beaker seem to time out. Why are big files difficult to host? Will Beaker eventually be able to do this? Are more seeders necessary?

- What do a cup of coffee (my favicon) and the ellipsis punctuation mark (the namesake of this blog) have in common?

# dreams

- Application idea: Right click on any file, similar to Dropbox, and see "Share on dat" and copy dat URL to clipboard

- Webring for Beaker. I feel a little forgetful ... but how did old webrings work? Were they iFrames? How were they updated?

- Beaker Browser for mobile! But many questions here. Would it be read-only? That would feel wrong. What's an easy code editor for mobile? Or some other method?

- More support for DNS in Beaker (I heard this is coming!)

- Some sort of messaging layer in Beaker
