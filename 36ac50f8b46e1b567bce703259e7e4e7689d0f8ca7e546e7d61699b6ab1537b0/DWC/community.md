communities and new infrastructures
---

I grew up in a small city in China. Google had a seperate branch of their company in China. Google China allowed the Chinese government to censor their content. Right before I started middle school, Google decided to stop allowing such sensorship and ended up exiting China. The government therefore blocked Google as a whole.
