For the summer 2018 Skillshares of the Distributed Web of Care project, we experimented with small activities to collectively care and create. As we are wrapping up the summer, we decided to write small letters to the artists and thinkers who presented at the series. The letters also links to peer-to-peer poetry, letters, and zines created during the events. Everything linked from here on is published on the distributed web. The pages do not have a centralized ownership, which means only the owner of the individual pieces will have access to edit or delete the content. We are imaging a form of publishing that is built with care, freedom, and distributed responsibility.
