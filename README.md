A class at the [Code Societies](http://sfpc.io/codesocieties), School for Poetic Computation, Summer 2018

Distributed Web of Care is an initiative to *code to care* and *code carefully*. In this class, we will investigate centralized, decentralized, distributed and peer to peer networks. We will analyze the popular platforms such as Instagram and technical platforms such as GitHub, focusing on the network structure and protocols. We will experiment with strings and stickers to visualize and embody different types of network. We will imagine the kinds of network we want for the future and we will discuss how we can build it with code and code of conduct. We will distribute our work (poetry, code, or something else) over distributed network using [Dat](http://datproject.org/), 
[Beaker browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) and [Cabal](https://github.com/cabal-club/cabal).

# creating 

- dat create : You are creating your own dat archive. 

- dat keys: In case you forget your key, you can get it again.  

- dat share: You will start to seed your data. You can also command dat share [key]

- dat sync: You can connect to a remote dat, and live sync to it's changes.

# Activity 

- Exquisite corpse: write a story that's continued by your classmate 
- use nano to make a txt file of your story.

- give your key to the neighbors on your left and right
- connect the stories with <a href="dat://key">Before</a> and <a href="dat://key">Next</a>.

## Browser + publisher  

- Install [Beaker browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/)

Try visiting 

- Laurel Schwulst - dat://5793d06772ebec92a6b343e7187d39e4e6be6dee73d7b233269b48408c4a34fb

Try forking

# Seeding

Seeding, publishing, sharing.

- Self hosting on a [Raspberry Pi](https://guides.newcomputers.group/guides/installing-dat-raspberry-pi.html)

- [Hashbase](https://hashbase.io/):  a public peer for files published with the Dat protocol. Works nicely with Beaker. File size limit for free account. 

# Chatting 

Time permitting, follow this tutorial on [cabal](https://guides.newcomputers.group/guides/cabal.html)

## Homework 1 (highly suggested): Code Societies Zine 

Update your zine by July 26th 6pm. Send DM to Taeyoon to inform the zine has been updated. The compiled zines will be compiled and premiere at the [Decentralized Web Summit](https://decentralizedweb.net/) in SF.   

## Homework: DIY Social Media 

Back up your favorite social media platform, download all content, create a distributed web version of the content.
