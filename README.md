A class at the [Code Societies](http://sfpc.io/codesocieties), School for Poetic Computation, Summer 2018

Distributed Web of Care is an initiative to *code to care* and *code carefully*. In this class, we will investigate centralized, decentralized, distributed and peer to peer networks. We will analyze the popular platforms such as Instagram and technical platforms such as GitHub, focusing on the network structure and protocols. We will experiment with strings and stickers to visualize and embody different types of network. We will imagine the kinds of network we want for the future and we will discuss how we can build it with code and code of conduct. We will distribute our work (poetry, code, or something else) over distributed network using [Dat](http://datproject.org/), 
[Beaker browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) and [Cabal](https://github.com/cabal-club/cabal).
